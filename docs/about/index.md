About Sifo
==========
Sifo is an Open Source PHP Framework originally developed by **Albert Lombarte**. It is designed to support website inheritance, true multi language, scaling, and all the tools for debugging and quick development. 


History
-------
In the summer of 2009 I received a phone call from a good friend who was running a start-up company. He wanted to hire my services to develop a custom, SEO-oriented, PHP framework for an e-commerce site.

I rejected the offer and I told him I would do it for free because I wanted this framwork for myself anyway and I would use his project to have another application running over it. So I created the essence of what Sifo is today, only that was named SEOframework (Sifo came up later spontaneously as the name was tooooo long).

In the autumn of 2009 Splitweet.com (acquired in 2012 by the canadians Hootsuite) was the first application online with Sifo. And several others came right after accompanied by 10-15 additional contributors to the private SVN repository (all close friends and developers).

Two years after an extensive private usage, enhancements, testing and multiple online applications the last private SVN commit #1024 was accepted and everything was moved to Github (summer 2011).

Since 2011 the project keeps moving on and evolving every day thanks to companies and individuals with the spirit of the Open Source movement. If you want to contribute the project, we cannot be happier.
