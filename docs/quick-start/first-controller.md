Your first controller
=====================
> Because everyone needs to put a Hello World in their life.

When you explore the controllers for first time you should have a look at the file `instances/common/controllers/home/index.ctrl.php` or grab a copy of the instance `sifo-web` that powers this site (see the footer for source code) and then explore what is done.

The first thing to notice is the Class naming and file class name. You can work with or without the `.ctrl.` extension.
The minimum layout to run a controller is the following:

	<?php

    namespace Common;

    class HomeIndexController extends \Sifo\Controller
	{
	        public function build()
	        {
	                $this->setLayout( 'home/index.tpl' );
	        }
	}

Note that the class contains the folder where its located (`home`) first letter is capital and the type ( `Controller` )

If you create a new controller in your instance then you need to add a namespace with your instance name (upper case first) at the beginning of the file. For example, if you created the instance `myinstance` and you want to create your own custom version of this same file, it would look like:

    <?php

    namespace Myinstance;

	class HomeIndexController extends \Sifo\Controller
	{
	        public function build()
	        {
	                $this->setLayout( 'home/index.tpl' );
	        }
	}

Whenever you create a controller you have to execute the URL http://myinstance.local/rebuild to tell the application there is a new file available in the code. Sifo will never do `file_exists` because is a performance killer, that's the programmer responsibility.

Finally the `setLayout()` method defines what template will be used (as starting template, many others can be contained in it). The route is relative to the `templates` folder.
